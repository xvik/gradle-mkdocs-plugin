Python \u00b6 Important Plugin based on python plugin which implements all python-related staff like virtualenv creation, pip modules installation and python commands execution. Mkdocs plugin just provides mkdocs-specific tasks above it. For all python-related configuration see python plugin documentation It was an initial goal to write two plugins instead of one in order to be able to easilly create plugins for other python modules (if required). Requires installed python 3.8 and above with pip. Check and install python if required . Note Plugin will not affect global python: it will create project-specific virtualenv (in .gradle/python ) and install all required (pip) modules there. This will grant build reproduction (once initialized virtualenv used for all future executions). Tip It is completely normal to manually remove virtualenv folder ( .gradle/python ) in case of problems to re-create environment. There is also a cleanPython task for this. Docker \u00b6 If you have docker installed, you can use python from docker container : python . docker . use = true In this case global python installation is not required. Tip To learn how docker used read python plugin documentation Usage \u00b6 By default, documentation source assumed to be in src/doc . Tip Default location could be changed: mkdocs.sourcesDir = 'docs' Call mkdocsInit task to generate initial site version (into src/doc by default): src/doc/ docs/ - documentation source ... index.md mkdocs.yml - site configuration Note Plugin does not use mkdocs new command for site generation: custom template used with pre-configured plugins and enabled material theme. Call mkdocsServe task to start live reload server to see default site: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ . Tip Used port may be changed: mkdocs.devPort = 4000 . Note that this setting overrides dev_addr in mkdocs.yml! Warning Python process may not be killed after you stop gradle execution (search and kill python process manually). This is a known gradle problem and the only known workaround is to start task without daemon: gradlew mkdocsServe --no-daemon . Another alternative is to start serve command directly: copy console command from task execution log and use it directly. When docker used, container should be properly shut down, but not immediately (about 10s). Initial site configuration \u00b6 Open generated mkdocs config file src/doc/mkdocs.yml . It contains many commented options: Commented option Recommendation site_author fill with you name or remove (appear in meta tags only) site_url Set to documentation root url (gh-pages url). Used as meta tag, as a link on the home icon and inside generated sitemap.xml. NOTE plugin will automatically modify url to point to correct published folder (when multi-version publication used). Repository link on each page (right top corner) repo_name Source repository link text (by default set to project name) repo_url Repository url (Github or Bitbucket) edit_uri Path to documentation source in the source repository (required for \"edit page\" (pencil icon) link) Copyright copyright Shown below each page For material theme configuration see: configuration docs . Read about navigation configuration to fine tune navigation menus behavior (in theme.features section). Note Material theme supports docs version selector natively , but requires mike tool. Gradle plugin provides its own publishing implementation (not requiring mike) with exactly the same features (but easier to configure from gradle). So if you want version switcher, just enable it as shown in docs and it will work. Another commonly used feature is dark theme toggle Writing \u00b6 Yaml configuration nav section declares your documentation structure. Pages inside docs folder may be structured as you want. To add new page simply add new markdown file (page.md) and add reference to it in nav config section. Note All changes are immediately appeared in the started live reload server ( mkdocsServe ) You can use gradle-driven variables , for example, to insert project version in docs. Read: Mkdocs getting started guide . Mkdocs-material extensions . Mkdocs config generated by mkdocsInit task already enables all extensions according to recommended configuration . But you still need to know how to use them, so read this section. Tip If you want to use a different theme (not material) then you'll need to configure it Building \u00b6 Warning You will need to stop livereload server in order to build By default, mkdocsBuild task will generate (suppose project version is '1.0-SNAPSHOT'): build/mkdocs/ /1.0-SNAPSHOT/ - mkdocs site index.html - redirect to correct site Note Also, versions.json file generated during publication (for version switcher) Plugin is configured for multi-version documentation publishing: each version is in it's own folder and special index.html at the root will redirect to the latest version (when published). Everything in build/mkdocs/ is assumed to be published into github pages (preserving all other already published folders). Default configuration: mkdocs . publish { docPath = '$version' rootRedirect = true } As documentation is often updated for already released version, it makes sense to define current version manually (or define it when you need to publish to exact version): mkdocs . publish . docPath = '1.0' Tip See multi-version section for how to publish older docs version Tip You can also use version aliases like latest or dev or 1.x and perform root redirection to alias instead of exact version (common case, show 'latest') See examples section with most common configurations. Single version site \u00b6 If you don't want to use multi-version support at all then: mkdocs.publish.docPath = '' // or null This way, mkdocs site will always be published at the root (in case of publish it will always replace previous site version). Publication \u00b6 When documentation site will be ready, you will need to call mkdocksPublish in order to publish it to github pages (default). If your repo is https://github.com/me/my-project then documentation will be available as https://me.github.io/my-project/ . Published index.html at the root will immediately redirect you to the actual version: https://me.github.io/my-project/1.0.0/ . See more about publication customization in publication section. It also describes how to publish additional parts with documentation site (like javadoc). Custom publication \u00b6 If you don't plan to use publication into git then there is a lightweight plugin version without publication tasks: plugins { id 'ru.vyarus.mkdocs-build' version '4.0.0' } Full ru.vyarus.mkdocs plugin actually enables ru.vyarus.mkdocs-build plus configures publication tasks. So plugins are completely equal in functionality except publication. Note Root redirection (index.html) and aliases are all generated with mkdocsBuild task, so you will not lose these features. But versions.json file is generated only during publication (required for version switcher, generated by analyzing existing folders in git branch) Incremental versions \u00b6 Plugin provides two mechanisms for managing versions.json file (required for version switcher in documentation). By default, during publication ( mkdocsPublish task) plugin will generate versions.json based on folders in the target git branch. This is the safest option as it will detect all removed documentation versions and update versions file accordingly. But, if you don't use git publication, you can enable \"incremental versions\": on build plugin would simply add new version to the existing versions file. To enable this just specify current versions file: mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'path/to/actual/versions.json' Or use an url to existing documentation site: mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'https://xvik.github.io/gradle-mkdocs-plugin/versions.json' Note This mechanism will create new file each time it can't find configured file (in order to support first publication case).

Configuration, responsible for versioning: mkdocs . publish { docPath = '$version' rootRedirect = true rootRedirectTo = '$docPath' versionTitle = '$docPath' versionAliases = [] hideVersions = [] hideOldBugfixVersions = false generateVersionsFile = true } Tip Usually it is more handy to manually set current doc version and not rely on project version because often documentation for currently released version is updated multiple times after release. Important Mkdocs-material suggests mike tool usage for publication. Gradle plugin implements absolutely the same workflow as mike, but much easier customizable (as gradle plugin). Material theme would still be able to show version switcher because plugin generates required versions.json file. Workflow \u00b6 Usually you work on documentation for current version only. When new version released - you publish new documentation version and continue evolving it. Old version stays published for the legacy users. Older version update \u00b6 When older documentation version needs to be updated switch off redirection index.html generation (so it would not override redirection to the latest version): mkdocs . publish { docPath = '0.9' rootRedirect = false // site root must still redirect to '1.0' (assume it's already published) } Will build (without root index.html): build/mkdocs/ /0.9/ - mkdocs site for old version Also, do not use versionAliases when publishing old version because it may override more recent docs version. Plugin would try to warn you in such cases: WARNING : Publishing version ' 1.0 ' is older then the latest published ' 1.1 ' and the following overrides might not be desired : root redirect override to ' 1.0 ' existing alias ' latest ' override existing alias ' 1. x ' override Important This warning is produced by mkdocsVersionsFile file and only when versions.json file generation is not disabled. This check can't be done under mkdocsBuild because publishing repository is required for validation. So please, when releasing an old version use mkdocsVersionsFile to see all possible warnings before actual publication. Publication layouts \u00b6 You may define whatever layout you want, e.g.: mkdocs.publish.docPath = 'en/1.0/' Here generated site will be published into /en/1.0/ folder (not just version) and index.html generated at the root with correct redirection. Warning If you want to use version switcher then you should not use long version paths, because mkdocs-material would look for versions file only at one level up . Aliases \u00b6 It is possible to publish version not only into version folder, but also into aliased folders. Could be useful for: Publishing the latest documentation under latest alias, so users could always reference the latest docs with the same link. Publishing docs for developing version under dev alias, so users could easily find dev docs. Serving the latest (patch) version for some mojor version: e.g. 5.x alias could serve the latest published bugfix. For example, to add latest alias: mkdocs . publish { docPath = '1.0' rootRedirect = true versionAliases = [ 'latest' ] } Will build: build/mkdocs/ /0.9/ /latest/ index.html Note Alias folder contains a copy of generated documentation, which means that sitemap links would lead to path of exact version. If same version is re-published - aliases would be correctly updated too. It is also possible to redirect root into alias instead of exact version with rootRedirectTo option: mkdocs . publish { versionAliases = [ 'latest' ] rootRedirectTo = 'latest' } Tip In case of root redirection to alias it is better to enable version switcher to clearly show what version is active now (otherwise it would be not obvious) Doc version switcher \u00b6 Version switcher might be enabled in mkdocs.yml exactly as described in docs : extra : version : provider : mike Important You don't need mike itself! Important You will not see switcher under mkdocsServe command, but if you call mkdocsVersionsFile (which would also call mkdocsBuild ), and manually open new version it would show switcher with all versions (using generated versions.json) Mkdocs-material requires only versions.json file stored at docs root. Plugin would automatically generate such file (following mike syntax): Plugin verifies actually existing directories in gh-pages repository and would add them to generated versions file. So if you already have many versions published, just publish new version with enabled versions support and you'll see all of them in the version switcher. Theme folders are detected by using \\d+(\\..*)? regexp (version folder must start with a number) and it must contain 404.html file. Deeper versions folders are also supported: e.g. if mkdocs.publish.docPath = 'en/1.0/' then `en/1.0' folder would be recognized as version Existing records in versions.json file are preserved for found version folders. You can modify file manually (e.g. to modify version title) and it will not be overridden on next publication You can manually remove version folder in repository and on next publication versions.json would be corrected If aliases used, they would be correctly updated (e.g. latest removed from previous latest version.) If you do not want to generate versions file: mkdocs.publish.generateVersionsFile = false To customize version title (shown in dropdown selection) use: mkdocs.publish.versionTitle = '1.0 (important fix)' Incremental versions \u00b6 There is an alternative way for versions.json file generation for cases when publishing task is not used (e.g. when lightweight ru.vyarus.mkdocs-build plugin used). The idea is to use existing versions file and add new version into it (in contrast, git based publication could detect removed version folders and remove versions from file accordingly). Tip Version aliases would be also correctly processed. To enable incremental versions generation, specify current versions file location: mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'path/to/actual/versions.json' You can also use a URL (http, ftp or anything that URL could handle): mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'https://xvik.github.io/gradle-mkdocs-plugin/versions.json' When file specified, mkdocsBuild would load current file and apply new version there (if required). Updated versions file would be available in target build directory (same as with git publication). Important There will not be an error if file not found or due to download error - instead plugin would consider current file as not existing and would create a fresh versions file. This is useful for the first publication. Note When git publication used, incremental versions file, generated by mkdocsBuild would be overridden by versions file, generated by publishing task. If required, it could be disabled with mkdocs.publish.generateVersionsFile = false , but keep in mind that publication mechanism is safer to use. Hide versions \u00b6 If you publish documentation for each released version, after some time you may notice too many versions in the version selector. Often some versions become not relevant and could be hidden (it would not be correct to remove old version folder). For example, suppose we have: 1.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3. It makes no sense to keep old bugfix versions in the version chooser: mkdocs . publish . hideVersions = [ '1.1.0' , '1.1.1' , '1.1.2' ] Now version selector would show only '1.0' and '1.1.3' versions, but all hidden versions would still be accessible by direct link. Important Version hiding does not work for incremental versions (where the current version is just appended into some existing versions file inside mkdocsBuild task). For bugfix versions (like in the example above) plugin could hide versions automatically: mkdocs . publish . hideOldBugfixVersions = true Note Automatic versions hiding does not try to be too smart: 1. It looks only versions with the same \"base\" part (same number of dots). E.g. 2.0.0, 2.0.1 or 2.0.0.1, 2.0.0.2, but would not compare 2.0.0 and 2.0.0.1 2.

Serving the latest (patch) version for some mojor version: e.g. 5.x alias could serve the latest published bugfix. For example, to add latest alias: mkdocs . publish { docPath = '1.0' rootRedirect = true versionAliases = [ 'latest' ] } Will build: build/mkdocs/ /0.9/ /latest/ index.html Note Alias folder contains a copy of generated documentation, which means that sitemap links would lead to path of exact version. If same version is re-published - aliases would be correctly updated too. It is also possible to redirect root into alias instead of exact version with rootRedirectTo option: mkdocs . publish { versionAliases = [ 'latest' ] rootRedirectTo = 'latest' } Tip In case of root redirection to alias it is better to enable version switcher to clearly show what version is active now (otherwise it would be not obvious)","title":"Aliases"},{"location":"guide/multi-version/#doc-version-switcher","text":"Version switcher might be enabled in mkdocs.yml exactly as described in docs : extra : version : provider : mike Important You don't need mike itself! Important You will not see switcher under mkdocsServe command, but if you call mkdocsVersionsFile (which would also call mkdocsBuild ), and manually open new version it would show switcher with all versions (using generated versions.json) Mkdocs-material requires only versions.json file stored at docs root. Plugin would automatically generate such file (following mike syntax): Plugin verifies actually existing directories in gh-pages repository and would add them to generated versions file. So if you already have many versions published, just publish new version with enabled versions support and you'll see all of them in the version switcher. Theme folders are detected by using \\d+(\\..*)? regexp (version folder must start with a number) and it must contain 404.html file. Deeper versions folders are also supported: e.g. if mkdocs.publish.docPath = 'en/1.0/' then `en/1.0' folder would be recognized as version Existing records in versions.json file are preserved for found version folders. You can modify file manually (e.g. to modify version title) and it will not be overridden on next publication You can manually remove version folder in repository and on next publication versions.json would be corrected If aliases used, they would be correctly updated (e.g. latest removed from previous latest version.)

The idea is to use existing versions file and add new version into it (in contrast, git based publication could detect removed version folders and remove versions from file accordingly). Tip Version aliases would be also correctly processed. To enable incremental versions generation, specify current versions file location: mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'path/to/actual/versions.json' You can also use a URL (http, ftp or anything that URL could handle): mkdocs . publish . existingVersionsFile = 'https://xvik.github.io/gradle-mkdocs-plugin/versions.json' When file specified, mkdocsBuild would load current file and apply new version there (if required). Updated versions file would be available in target build directory (same as with git publication). Important There will not be an error if file not found or due to download error - instead plugin would consider current file as not existing and would create a fresh versions file. This is useful for the first publication. Note When git publication used, incremental versions file, generated by mkdocsBuild would be overridden by versions file, generated by publishing task.

Often some versions become not relevant and could be hidden (it would not be correct to remove old version folder). For example, suppose we have: 1.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3. It makes no sense to keep old bugfix versions in the version chooser: mkdocs . publish . hideVersions = [ '1.1.0' , '1.1.1' , '1.1.2' ] Now version selector would show only '1.0' and '1.1.3' versions, but all hidden versions would still be accessible by direct link. Important Version hiding does not work for incremental versions (where the current version is just appended into some existing versions file inside mkdocsBuild task). For bugfix versions (like in the example above) plugin could hide versions automatically: mkdocs . publish . hideOldBugfixVersions = true Note Automatic versions hiding does not try to be too smart: 1. It looks only versions with the same \"base\" part (same number of dots). E.g. 2.0.0, 2.0.1 or 2.0.0.1, 2.0.0.2, but would not compare 2.0.0 and 2.0.0.1 2.

On the first mkdocsPublish task call: gh-pages branch will be created in the same repo built site pushed to gh-pages repository branch Later mkdocsPublish task calls will only remove current version folder (replace with the new one) or publish completely new version only. You can find actual gh-pages branch inside .gradle/gh-pages (this checkout is used for publishing). Gradle folder is used to cache repository checkout because eventually it would contain many versions and there is no need to checkout all of them each time (folder could be changed with mkdocs.publish.repoDir ). Authentication \u00b6 By default, grgit will ask credentials with a popup (swing).

Plugin will automatically bind gradle properties org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.* to system properties (just before gitPublishReset ). This allows you to define credentials as global gradle properties in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties : org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username = user org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password = pass For testing, you can define properties inside gradle script: ext [ 'org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username' ] = 'user' ext [ 'org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password' ] = 'pass' Publish additional resources \u00b6 If you want to publish not only generated site, but something else too then configure plugin to include additional content.

To avoid compatibility problems, extra configuration and publication tasks preserved the same: gitPublish configuration for git publication configurations. For most cases, plugin configures it itself. Still, it may be useful for merging configuration with other files . Tasks: gitPublishReset - checkout repository mkdocsVersionsFile - generate versions.json file for version switcher gitPublishCopy - copy (and add) files into repository gitPublishCommit - commit updates into repository gitPublishPush - push commit mkdocsPublish - publish to github pages (main task) Normally, you just need to call mkdocsPublish to perform publication and mkdocsVersionsFile could be called directly to verify versions file update correctness.
