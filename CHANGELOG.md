* Fix non-strict build (#88)

### 4.0.0 (2024-04-14)
* (breaking) Drop gradle 5 and 6 support
* All tasks properties replaced with lazy properties
* Remove git-publish plugin. Plugin functions added directly with required modifications
  so usage will be the same (compatible). The Author of the original plugin deprecated it
  (together with grgit). Still, grgit will be used for now (because of its feature completeness)
  - Authorization properties support remains for backwards compatibility, but auth could
    be specified now directly in gitPublish.username (and password). 
* Configuration cache compatibility
* Update packages:
  - mkdocs 1.4.1 -> 1.5.3
  - mkdocs-material 8.5.7 -> 9.5.17
  - pygments 2.13.0 -> 2.17.2
  - pymdown-extensions 9.7 -> 10.7.1
* Support hiding versions in versions file:
  - mkdocs.publish.hideVersions - set versions to hide 
  - mkdocs.publish.hideOldBugfixVersions - automatically hide bugfix versions (disabled by default)

### 3.0.0 (2022-11-01)
* (breaking) Drop gradle 5.0-5.2 support (minimum required gradle is 5.3)
* Python plugin related changes: 
  - Add docker support (with raw python container by default)
  - Add python requirements.txt file support
  - Add cleanPython task to easily cleanup local environment 
* Dev server port number is now configurable: devPort property
  (this required for proper docker support when non-local ip must be specified)
* mkdocs.resolveDocPath() never return null:
  for single version docs '.' is returned now instead of null (#41) 
* Update packages:
  - mkdocs 1.3.0 -> 1.4.1
  - mkdocs-material 8.3.6 -> 8.5.7
  - pygments 2.12.0 -> 2.13.0 
  - pymdown-extensions 9.4 ->  9.7
* Ignore all git errors during plugin initialization (git used to resolve repoUrl on initialization) (#45)
* Split plugin into 2 plugins to let users use plugin without custom publication implementation:
  - mkdocs-build - everything without publication (and no grgit plugin activation)
  - mkdocs - same as before (registers mkdocs-build plugin and configures publication tasks)
* mkdocsBuild task could now update existing versions file (even download from URL) (#31)
  - To enable specify existing versions file location: mkdocs.publish.existingVersionsFile = '...'
  - When target file not found new (empty) one would be created
  - Ideal for incremental publishing when each publication just adds a new version to existing file
    (when git publication is not used)

WARNING: minimum recommended python is 3.8

### 2.4.0 (2022-06-17)
* Fix variables support for gradle 7.4 (#34)
* Update packages:
  - mkdocs-material 8.2.8 -> 8.3.6
  - pygments 2.11.2 -> 2.12.0
  - pymdown-extensions 9.1 ->  9.4

  - mkdocs 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0 (fixes #29: jinja2 3.1.0 support)
  - mkdocs-material 8.0.2 -> 8.2.8
  - pygments 2.10.0 -> 2.11.2

    See breaking changes: https://www.mkdocs.org/about/release-notes/#backward-incompatible-changes-in-12

  - mkdocs-material 7.0.6 -> 8.0.2
    Migration notes: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/upgrade/#upgrading-from-7x-to-8x

    * replace codehilite extension with pymdownx.highlight
    * to activate light/dark theme toggle (#12)
      https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#color-palette-toggle
  - pygments 2.8.0 -> 2.10.0
  - pymdown-extensions 8.1.1 -> 9.1
* Update mkdocs.yaml generated by init task with most useful options commented
* Add support for version switcher (without mike tool usage), by generating versions.json from publish repository folders (#10)
  - New option mkdocs.publish.generateVersionsFile could disable versions.json file generation
  - File generated by new mkdocsVersionsFile task which may be used instead of mkdocsBuild to test switcher
* Add aliases support (same way as in mike), declared with new option mkdocs.publish.versionAliases
* Add mkdocs.publish.rootRedirectTo option to be able to configure root redirection into alias

### 2.1.2 (2021-12-01)
* Fix java 8 support, dropped due to jgit 6 transitive dependency (#13)

### 2.1.1 (2021-03-18)
* Fix variables support ignore 'docs_dir' configuration from mkdocs.yml (#8)

### 2.1.0 (2021-03-17)
* Support python installed from Windows Store (use-python-plugin 2.3.0)
* Update packages:
    - mkdocs 1.1 -> 1.1.2
    - mkdocs-material 4.6.3 -> 7.0.6
    - pygments 2.6.1 -> 2.8.0
    - pymdown-extensions 6.3.0 -> 8.1.1
* Optional variables support for all mkdocs tasks: there is no (and not planned) native support for 
   variables in mkdocs, but often it is very handful. It is only possible to have it with a plugin. (#7)
    - Added mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin 0.2.4 as installed module (no harm, you must active it manually!)
    - Added mkdocs.extras configuration option: map to declare additional variables
    - When extra variables declared, plugin would generate a special file, containing all declared variables,
      which markdownextradata plugin would recognize and use automatically. 
    - Variables must be used with 'gradle' prefix: {{ gradle.declared_var_name }}
