# Migration notes

!!! summary
    This section mostly describes main changes in updated mkdocs and material
    versions, assuming you'll use default versions (provided by plugin).

## 4.0.0

Gradle 5-6 not supported anymore.

## 3.0.0

Gradle 5.0-5.2 is not supported anymore.

Use python 3.8 and above: there might be problem with `importlib-metadata 5.0` package
installed by version range (transitive dependency) and incompatible with python < 3.8

Plugin can use docker now instead of local python: `mkdocs.docker.use = true`

New configuration `mkdocs.devPort` overrides `dev_addr` configuration in your mkdocs.yml
(this was required for proper docker support).
If you need to change default port (3000), use gradle config to change it

If you don't need git publication tasks, you can now use lightweight plugin version:
```gradle 
id 'ru.vyarus.mkdocs-build' version '3.0.0'
```

There is also a way now to update existing versions.json file in case when git publication not used:
configure current file location with `mkdocs.publish.existingVersionsFile = 'https://xvik.github.io/gradle-mkdocs-plugin/versions.json'`
(or local path) and `mkdocsBuild` would generate updated versions.json inside mkdocs build dir. 

## 2.4.0

Python 3.6 is not supported anymore, use python 3.7 - 3.10.

## 2.3.0

There is no breaking changes since 2.2.0, but if you're migrating from earlier version please see
[2.2.0 migration notes](https://xvik.github.io/gradle-mkdocs-plugin/2.2.0/about/migration/).
