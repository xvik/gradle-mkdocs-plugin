     * {@code mkdocs.extras = ['long name': 10]} would be available as <pre>{{ gradle.long_name }}</pre> and
     * {@code mkdocs.extras = ['other-name': 10]} would be available as <pre>{{ gradle.other-name }}</pre> .

     * ({@code name:}) in the generated file.
     * <p>
     * Extra properties file is generated before any mkdocs task, including custom tasks
     * extending {@code MkdocsTask}. After task execution generated file is removed.

     * In most cases, variable values would be evaluated immediately, but if you need delayed (lazy) evaluation then
     * use "lazy-closure" trick: {@code extras = ['version': "${-> project.version}"]}. This time, version value
     * would be evaluated only before mkdocs task execution.
